We already know how to xref:plugin.xml-for-eclipse-rcp-app#[program "plugin.xml" for RCP app]. 

Programming "plugin.xml" for IDE app is not much different. There is only one difference: Wuff does not generate extension-point "org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications" for IDE apps. Instead, it uses the extension-point "org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench", provided by Eclipse libraries.
